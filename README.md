## Abstract

The results from this project provide an efficient system with better accuracy and less computation effort for leakage detection, which could be used in small-scale networks. Water is one of the most consumed; however, the commodity that has been least taken care of on this planet. On the other hand, Freshwater comprises 1% of the total water resource, making this even more precious. Over the past few decades, the loss of this precious resource from the distribution system during supply has become a significant issue. Proactive repairs can reduce water losses in developing countries. However, they lack the infrastructure to detect and locate leaks. The primary goal of a water supply company is to provide safe drinking water to its customers. However, the challenge is to improve financial conditions by reducing water losses. Therefore, various studies have been carried out to understand the importance of leak detection. Steady-state leakage detection uses pressures and flows as primary parameters to detect leaks in a network. Over the past few decades, the steady-state analysis for leakage detection has been a promising method with better efficiency but less accuracy.
